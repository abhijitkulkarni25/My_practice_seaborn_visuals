This is the practice repository to practice Seaborn.
Seaborn is a Python visualization library which is being stacked entirely on Matplotlib(https://matplotlib.org/).
It is used exclusively for statistical visualizations which can be used to convey results to a variety of audiences.
I would like to thank Alfred Essa (Vice President, Analytics and R&D at McGraw-Hill Education) for designing such an awesome tutorial for Seaborn
